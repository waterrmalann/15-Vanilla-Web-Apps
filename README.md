# 15 Days, 15 Vanilla Web Apps [HTML + CSS + JS]

---

A tiny challenge I'm taking to build 15 simple vanilla web apps in 15 days using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The primary focus of this challenge is JavaScript as I wanted each project to have an utility, though HTML and CSS have also been used extensively to make the apps visually pleasing.

| Day | App | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Eisenhower Decision Matrix | Task prioritization using eisenhower method. |
| 02 | Countdown Timer | Set a countdown (hrs, mins, seconds). |
| 03 | To-Do List | Simple task manager. |
| 04 | Date Distance Calculator | Calculate the amount of days between two dates. |
| 05 | Motivational Quotes | Random quotes to motivate. |

### Give it a try!

I encourage you to try something similar! Challenges are a great way to learn as well as improve your abilities. You can use this repository as a reference and try to create 15 tiny but useful web apps in 15 days. For an added challenge, try coming up with new ideas or add new features to the existing web apps.
